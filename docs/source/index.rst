Kirby Air Ride NetPlay Documentation
====================================

.. attention::
    :ref:`I originally left these docs up to ensure that another guide had time to beat out the SEO of this site. 
    Now that one has, this site no longer serves a purpose... I have moved onto other projects long ago. 
    Also I just do not care to keep things updated or pay for domain hosting. 
    At the end of 2024, this site will no longer be available.`

.. tip::
    :ref:`The website I am referring to above should realllyyyy hire someone experienced in web design. Just saying. Holy cow.`

The return of the kirbyairri.de website and guides! Written and hosted by Eternalll.

This is an independent project *not affiliated* with any community, here to spread the word of how to play Kirby Air Ride and the Hack Pack online.

.. note::
    :ref:`In no way is kirbyairri.de or the project maintainer responsible for damage done to your computer by failure to properly follow instructions. 
    No warranty or support is provided for anything outside of what is available to you by viewing this website.`
